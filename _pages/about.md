Welcome! I am a machine learning and reinforcement learning researcher who strives to solve difficult problems in AGI field. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/).

Currently I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science from the [Rochester Institute *of* Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) and my
B.E. in Software Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*ICDM*, *KDD*, *ICML*, *Neurips*, *MICCAI*, *ACM MM*, among other outlets. This [research](research) tries to solve RL online interaction unavailability under safety or economic concerns by using a broad variety of methods such as
offline learning, inverse RL, distributional RL, meta learning and active learning. While primarily focused on small dataset novel algorithm development, I am also enthusiastic in applying RL
technique to real-world problems in CV, NLP, recommender system, medicine, etc.
