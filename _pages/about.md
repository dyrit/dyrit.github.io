Welcome! I am a machine learning researcher and a current PhD candidate in Computing and Information Sciences at [Rochester Institute *of* Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). I am working in the [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) under my advisor [Dr. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu/).

My doctoral research focuses on active learning, including theory, algorithms, and applications. I am particularly interested in active learning with challenges such as noisy labels and limited validation labeling budgets. I am also closely collaborating with the [High-Energy-Density Physics (HEDP) Theory Group](https://www.lle.rochester.edu/education/research-areas/high-energy-density-physics-hedp-theory-group/) from [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/). 
My works have been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in *NeurIPS*, *AAAI*, *ICML*, *IOP:MLST*, among other outlets. In these [research projects](research), I try to solve challenging issues of multi-label active learning, noisy-label active learning, active testing-while-learning, active test-time adaptation of large pre-trained foundation models, and data-efficient physics-informed machine learning models. While primarily focused on machine learning novel algorithm development, I am enthusiastic about applying active learning and other learning techniques to real-world problems in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Scientific Experimental Design, Medical Research, Augmented & Virtual Reality, etc.
